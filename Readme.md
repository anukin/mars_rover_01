#Mars Rover Problem
This problem is about mars rover with initial position and a direction, which takes a bunch of input namely "l", "m", "r"
1. l = rotate left by 90
2. r = rotate right by 90
3. m = move ahead 

Expected output is the position of the rover after the operations.

##Building and setup
1. Clone this directory
2. cd
3. bundle exec rake
